Weight provided for Kitti street dataset, but specified weights for occlusion/non_occlusion and synthetic Sintel as well as Middleburry will be uploaded to the drive as well. 

Find weight as download here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oz1iC3YN-nwtedM5DxvT6pMvNgwz-gDN/view?usp=sharing

For dataset reference see:
